<li>Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why?</li>

it? Why?</li>

<li>My first impression of this website is that it is simple but nice. I think that it does its job well.</li>

<li>There is a menu in the top left of the screen. It has a search icon on the top right of the site. 
There are several articles and recipes down the middle of the site.</li>

<li>The site structure is a very common one. This makes it very intuitive to use.
This is what I expect the average website to look like.</li>

<li>I think that the graphics and media that this website displays are very fitting for the company and content.
The icons are very simple in accordance with Trader Joe's style.</li>

<li>I tried reloading the site several times, and it never took longer than a second to load.</li>

<li>The text is simple. It uses a professional font in black. The background color is a plain soft white.</li>

<li>The site had a drop down menu button on the top left and a search icon on the top right.
Both functions worked as expected.</li>

<li>This website has a minimalistic color scheme. It is uniform throughout the site and its menus.</li>

<li>The site both works well and looks good in full screen and smaller size windows.</li>

<li>As someone who loves simple and minimalitic designs, I thought that this website was well made.
I liked that it fit with the company's overall style.</li>
